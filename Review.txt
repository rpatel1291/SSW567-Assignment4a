Assignment 4a Review

   During the assignment, I was able to create the test cases first and build the class off the test cases. Only problem
   I ran into in this assignment was the test for number of commits. I was able to fo through all of my repos but writing a test case
   to check how many commits I have done for that repo was a bit confusing. I was not able to see it when going through the
   JSON result when calling the API. Besides that I was able to get all the test cases to run. In the README.md file has the Travis
   tag running too.
