# SSW567-Assignment4a
Develop with the Perspective of the Tester in mind
[![build status of master](https://travis-ci.org/rpatel1291/SSW567-Assignment4a.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rpatel1291/SSW567-Assignment4a)


## Background:
This assignment will require that you write code to interface with an external REST-based APIs.   We could have used almost any external APIs, but for this assignment we chose GitHub because many of its APIs are public and do not require any authorization or API Keys.   This simplifies both the use and setup.

For this assignment imagine that you have been asked to develop a function that will interface with GitHub in order to extract and present useful information to your user. The function will communicate using the RESTful services APIs provided by GitHub. The GitHub APIs will allow you to query for information about users, repositories, etc... which can be retrieved using the function, and then be displayed in the application.
What should make this assignment different from other programming assignments is in how you will approach it.  You should approach this assignment as a developer who more than anything else has the perspective of the tester in the front of your mind. 
The developer looks at the requirements and asks how should I design and implement this function, but the tester will ask questions such as what will I need to test for in this function?  And how will I test this function?   As you design and write the function as a developer, you should consider the perspective of the tester in any of your design and implementation decisions.   One deliverable of this assignment will be to reflect and comment on this.

Note:  we will be building on this assignment for next week, so you will definitely need to complete this assignment this week.

## Requirements:
You should write a function that will take as input a GitHub user ID. 
The output from the function will be a list of the names of the repositories that the user has, along with the number of commits that are in each of the listed repositories.

So, for example, if user John567 has 2 repositories named "Triangle567" and "Square567" each with some number of commits, then the function might output :
```
Repo: Triangle567 Number of commits: 10
Repo: Square567 Number of commits: 27
```
### Implementation requirements:

You should implement the application in Python 3.X, same as what you have been using for other assignments.
Retrieving a user's repositories:

To retrieve a user's list of repositories you can use this GitHub API:
```
https://api.github.com/users/<ID>/repos
```
Given a user <ID>, this API will return a list of JSON objects, one for each repositories for that user.  The "Name:" attribute of the JSON object will be the name of the repo.

For example, for the user "richkempinski" the URL would be:
```
https://api.github.com/users/richkempinski/repos
```
Put this URL into your browser to see the list of json results that are returned.  You should see that one of the repositories returned has the name "hellogitworld"
Retrieving the commits of a repository:
To retrieve the commits for a specific user repository, use this API:
```
https://api.github.com/repos/<ID>/<REPO>/commits
```
This API will take a user <ID> and the name of the <REPO> and will return a list of JSON objects, one object for each commit. All you need to do is count how many element are in this list to know the number of commits.
For example, for the user "richkempinski" and for the repository "hellogitworld" then th e URL would be:
```
https://api.github.com/repos/richkempinski/hellogitworld/commits
```
Put this URL into the browser to see the list of commits for the repo.
Recommended Modules:
You should use these modules in your program to make requests and to handle the results.
import requests
The requests module can be used to request data from the GitHub API service.
import json
The json module can be used to parse the json response data from the GitHub API.
Important:
The purpose of this assignment is NOT about writing a complex or pretty function.  This should be a simple implementation, and in fact, the implementation is small relative to the Triangle programming assignment.  But think about how you will test the function and how you can make testing easy to implement. 
Design and write the program in a way that will make it easy for anyone to test.
In addition to the function you should also include some unit tests similar to how you tested the Triangle program in HW 02a to prove to yourself that the program is behaving correctly.
The application code should be saved in a new repository on GitHub using the same GitHub ID that you used for the previous assignment.   Give this new repository a meaningful name.   For example, the name could be something like GitHubApi567
Link this application to Travis-ci to make it part of CI process.
Note that if you use the "requests" module you may need to install this package with pip.
See the .travis.yml file here:
```yaml
language: python
python:
  - "3.5"
install:
  - pip install requests
# command to run tests
script:
  - <YOU PUT YOUR COMMAND HERE>
```
Deliverables:
You have 2 deliverables for this assignment:
1. The GitHub URL to the repository containing your code.   
You should link this application to Travis-ci to make sure that the code builds.  The README should contain a badge that indicates that the build is successful and that your tests pass, Follow the same pattern as was done in the previous assignment.
Your grade for this part will be on having a complete program that meets the requirements and which demonstrates a correct result.
2. Write a description of what you thought about when you were designing the code.  What did *you* think was important to do to make it easy to test the program.  What are some of the challenges that you faced when testing this assignment.
 
WARNING:   If you make too many API requests of GitHub then you may reach a limit and then GitHub will start to give errors.   You can only perform so many tests of GitHub APIs within some period of time, so realize that if your tests are passing fine and then all of a sudden they start to fail, then it may be because you have exceeded the limits on GitHub.   You will need to stop testing and wait for a period of time before GitHub will allow further requests.
